sass has to be modular, use mixins
react should call API, use async, graphQL
use loader placeholders on one row
use loader gif when loading cards
fetch more on reaching bottom of page
cards gotta be hoverable, and on click flip
flipped card has some info on pokemon
perhaps night mode??? => set cookie, check if already set, use the set one, change cookie on theme change
have pc and mobile version

Noteable shit:
I put fetching into its own file, and it works!
